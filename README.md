## Purpose ##

This is a Basic Fundamental of how to take 
a vulnerable project and implement tools to 
attempt protect it, without working on the 
actual project...

## FirstStep ##

In order to be able to follow along with this 
course, you will need to have a basic understanding
of Python Object-Orientated-Programming.
If you do not have this covered, I suggest go to my
<a href="github.com/NixLyn/Basics/">
Basics</a> repo to understand how we are making use 
of functions outside of the main script


## Snort ##

In the '/Snort/' directory of this repo, you will find 
the basics of getting started with Snort
-> installation
-> configuration
-> implementation


### ``` To Get Started ``` ###

Navigate to ``` Snort/README.md...```

## Self-Build ##

With the use of YouTube and Google (A.I. not required),
you can spend the same amount of time building your own
version of Snort, while also learning much more about 
basic networking and packets...

... and since we built it ourselves, we can implement it
in whichever way we see fit...

### ``` To Get Started ``` ###

Navigate to ``` SelfBuild/part_1/README.md...```
