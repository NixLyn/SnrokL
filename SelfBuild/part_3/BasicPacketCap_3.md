# Bare Basic of Packet Capture #

### What We Will Cover ###

-> Creating profiles
-> Saving Packets


## Main ##

### Creating profiles ###

For this particular part I have created my own
'File_Man' for handling the reading and writing 
of data on files

So first we will create a directory for profiles,
then for each profile we will create a directory 
inside the profiles directory

### Saving Packets ###

For each packet, there will be a src or dest addr
so if the src addr is our own, we can denote that 
the packet is going outbound, and vice versa
